# ELLIPTICAL-CURVE-CRYPTOGRAPHY
This project is an implementation of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) using MATLAB. The goal of this project is to provide a basic understanding of the mathematical principles behind ECC and how it can be used for secure communication.

Elliptic curve cryptography is a modern public-key cryptography technique that provides a higher level of security than traditional methods such as RSA. The basic idea behind ECC is to use points on an elliptic curve over a finite field to represent public keys. The private key is a random number that is used to compute a shared secret key.

This MATLAB implementation of ECC includes the following functionalities:

Key generation: The code generates public and private keys for use in the ECC algorithm.

Encryption: The code uses the public key to encrypt a message.

Decryption: The code uses the private key to decrypt the encrypted message.

Digital signatures: The code allows the user to sign a message with their private key, and anyone can verify the authenticity of the message using the public key.

Key exchange: The code implements the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol using elliptic curves.

The code is well-commented and easy to follow, making it a great resource for students or anyone interested in learning about elliptic curve cryptography.
